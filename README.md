# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and execute all the ways one can use Microsoft Excel to organize, analyze and visualize data. 
For this assignment we are using a dataset called "Kickstarter" to help Louise set up her incentives by first seeing how launch months affect the success of the campaign and then by showing how much money people have donated to play campaigns historically. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The goal of this analysis is to find out how theater campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates. In order to do that I created a PivotTable and a line graph to better visualize my findings.

From the above graph we can easily see that the most successful month for theater productions is **May** followed by **June**. The least successful month for theater productions is **December**. This calls for a conclusion that Louise should plan to launch her play in May for the best outcome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate how successful the campaigns are depending on the value range of a desired funraising goal.

As one can see, most successful campaigns tend to reach their fundraising goal when they set their goal to be either **under $5000** or **between $35,000 and $45,000**. We know that Louise estimates her play will cost $12,000. Line chart demontrates that she has a 54% chance of being successful, which may make her rethink her strategy to increase her odds of putting on a successful play. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I struggled with Deliverable 2 because at first I was trying to create a line chart using just the initial table I created to calculate the percentages of successful vs unsuccessful play fundrasing goals. I had a very hard time manipulating the values and creating a visual representation that matches my expectations. I later added a PivotTable to help organize my findings and that solved the issue.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

> 1. It's best to launch a play campaign in May and run it through the summer for the for the most successful outcome. 
> 2. Play campaigns that launch in December tend to end up being least successful ones. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

> Play campaigns tend to reach their fundraising goal when they set it to be under $5000 or between $35,000 and $45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

> This dataset only shows campaigns launched in 2011 and then between 2014 and 2017, so it's missing data for 2012 through 2013, which means it's lacking some data for comparisons and might lead to inconsistent findings.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

> We can create a column chart to visualize the findings of the Outcomes based on Launch Date.
