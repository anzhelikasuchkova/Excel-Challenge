# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and execute all the ways one can use Microsoft Excel to organize, analyze and visualize data. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The goal of this analysis is to find out how theater campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates. In order to do that I created a PivotTable and a line graph to better visualize my findings.

From the above graph we can easily see that the most successful month for theater productions is May followed by June. The least successful month for theater productions is December. This calls for a conclusion that Louise should plan to launch her play in May for the best outcome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate how successful the campaigns are depending on the value range of a desired funraising goal.

As one can see, most successful campaigns tend to reach their fundraising goal when they set their goal to be either under $5000 or between $35,000 and $45,000. We know that Louise estimates her play will cost $12,000. Line chart demontrates that she has a 54% chance of being successful, which may make her rethink her strategy to increase her odds of putting on a successful play. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I struggled with Deliverable 2 because at first I was trying to create a line chart using just the initial table I created to calculate the percentages of successful vs unsuccessful play fundrasing goals. I had a very hard time manipulating the values and creating a visual representation that matches my expectations. I later added a PivotTable to help organize my findings and that solved the issue and was way easier to do.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?



On my end of things my Excel likes to make charts hidden at times. It might be my Macbook's way of saving memory. Either way the chart is there, so I hope you see it on your end. Thank you!
