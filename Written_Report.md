# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

Kickstarter, like other crowdfunding platforms, allows project creators to add incentives for different pledge amounts. We can help Louise set up her incentives by first determining how much money people have pledged to campaigns historically. 
Louise estimates that her play will cost $12,000. 
she would benefit from additional visualization of the data so that she can see the outcomes of all the categories.
To provide Louise with a visual summary of the data in our pivot tables
Another valuable piece of data is the length of fundraising campaigns. Is the length of a campaign correlated with its success? To help Louise plan her campaign timeline, let's take a closer look at how campaign length might be tied to its outcome. 
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. 
However, May, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.
By using filters, we can see that theater follows the overall trend: there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in June, but that tapers off by the end of the year.
June seems to be a good month to launch a campaign!


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?



On my end of things my Excel likes to make charts hidden at times. It might be my Macbook's way of saving memory. Either way the chart is there, so I hope you see it on your end. Thank you!
